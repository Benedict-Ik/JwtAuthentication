# JwtAuthentication 

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates how to implement JWT Authentication in .NET 8.0 using ASP.NET Core Web API. It covers everything from configuring JWT in your project to generating tokens and securing your API endpoints. 

## Introduction
- JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.
- Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. For example, a claim may assert that "John Doe is an administrator" or "the expiration time of this token is 2023-10-01T00:00:00Z".
- JWT consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature. The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. The payload contains the claims. The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.
